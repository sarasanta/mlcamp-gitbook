## Jupyter

[Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/about.html) is an open source project "_born out of the IPython Project ... to support interactive data science and scientific computing across all programming languages"_. and with the Jupyter Notebook, you now have an open-source web application that allows both data-analysis and seamless sharing of those insights \(and code itself\) as simple documents. A key value of this is the ability for collaborators and learners to see, modify & extend code with the confidence of knowing they are using exactly the same underlying data and environment -- making it a great way to validate ideas or replicate experiments.

## Machine Learning

Machine learning is [described as ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)"_giving computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed"_. While traditional programming focuses on _telling_ computers what to do **using instructions**, machine learning focuses on _teaching_ computers to understand new concepts **using examples.**

## Python3

Python is a "[programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively](https://www.python.org/)". You can use Python for web development, graphical UI development, data sciences, system administration and rapid software development. Python 2.x is now considered _legacy, _and_ _Python 3.x is seen as the future of the language. For more comparisons read "[Should I use Python 2 or Python 3 for my development activity?"](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3). From the data sciences perspective, most popular packages have been ported to Python3 and many are phasing out support for Python 2. So if you are starting out now, it's best to go with Python 3.
