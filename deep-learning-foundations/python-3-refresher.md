## Python 3 Refresher

I've worked with Python as a hobbyist but only when I came to Machine Learning did I feel the need to put some more time and effort into practicing my Python programming skills. In particular, the trend towards using Jupyter and Anaconda as two fundamental tools means that I needed to get really familar with Python3. This[ Udacity beginner course](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110) serves as a good refresher option. It is described as a 5-week course. Let's see how long it takes if you devote a few hours to it at a time.

The course has 5 lessons

1. Numbers and Strings
2. Functions, Installation and Conditionals
3. Data Structures and Loops
4. Files and Modules
5. Case Study: Wikipedia Web Crawl
