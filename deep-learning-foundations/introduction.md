# Introduction

This is the start of the **Deep Learning Trail. **This compressed trail provides the foundations for Deep Learning, that will be useful if you want to then pursue advanced nanodegrees like [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.udacity.com/ai), [Self-Driving Cars](https://www.udacity.com/drive) or [Robotics](https://www.udacity.com/robotics).

The trail is primarily based on the [Deep Learning Foundations program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) and will try to provide relevant resources \(e.g., study notes, online articles and relevant resources\) that may be useful for those enrolled in that paid program.

### Deep Learning Foundations

This course has the following high-level topics: Each of these topics will be covered in its own article \(page\) under this section.

* Intro to Python \(refresher\)
* Neural Networks
* Convolutional Neural Networks \(CNN\)
* Recurrent Neural Networks \(RNN\)
* Generative Adversarial Networks \(GAN\)



#### **RESOURCES**

Because the DLF program is a paid one, the content is not necessarily available to those exploring this outside of it. However, we hope to also explore using the following "openly accessible" content sources in context:

* Udacity / [UD-730: Deep Learning by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730)
* Siraj Raval / [YouTube: Intro to Deep Learning \(Udacity\)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2-dafEMk2A7YdKv4XfKpfbTH5z6rEEj3)
* Fast.ai / [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](http://course.fast.ai/)
* Fast.ai / [Cutting Edge Deep Learning for Coders](http://course.fast.ai/part2.html)
